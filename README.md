# Be a windbag!

Windbag is a simple RAG application that combines a local code base and Code Llama. 

You can read a detailed write up of this code [on my blog](https://www.thediscoblog.com/extending-code-llama/). 

Note that as coded, this application makes a large assumption that the indexed code is written in Ruby. It's easy enough to make this more generic, however. 

Set up is easy! Just run

```bash
% pip install langchain langchain-community
```
